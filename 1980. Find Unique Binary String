//Its related to Cantors Diagonalisation 
//What we are doing is we are creating a binary string by taking ith bit of ith element, As it is given in question our string contains n unique binary string each of length n.
//We are adding by flipping the bit, if it is 0 then we are adding 1 and if it is 1 then we are adding 0
